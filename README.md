HTML/CSS demo for Twist Image project


* Integrate the design (in "_design.psd") using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
* There's only one page.
* The final product should be cross-browser (except for IE6).
* The logo should be clickable
* The form has no specific validation and should post the infos to the same page (the form should submit).
* Clicking the "I have read and agree to the Contest Rules" checkbox should open another checkbox (with the label "I would like to receive the upcoming news about Twist Image"). You should see it in the PSD as a layer comp called "opened".
